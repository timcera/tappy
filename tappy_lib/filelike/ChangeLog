Version 0.2.2

        * Several patches to Cat thanks to Alan Fairless

Version 0.2.1

	* Added filelike.open() functions, which tries to open files in
	  a smart manner (e.g. fetching URLs, transparent unzipping, etc)


Version 0.2.0:

  Architectural Changes:

    * Moved wrapper classes into filelike.wrappers
    * Created filelike.pipeline, which employs operator abuse to compose
      file wrappers using a unix pipeline style
  
  Functional Changes:
 
    * Allow _write() to return any unwritten data, which will be cached
      for later writing.  None may be returned if all data is written.
      Also give it a <flushing> argument to indicate when no more data
      will be forthcoming
    * Validate access mode before reading/writing in FileLikeBase
    * Permit seperate reading and writing translation functions for TransFile
    * Added the following FileWrapper subclasses:
    			* PaddedToBlockSizeFile: ensure file's contents meet a blocksize
    			* Head: similar to unix `head` command
    			* Cat: similar to unix `cat` command
    			* BZ2File: similar to that found in the std lib
