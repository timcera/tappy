"""
The filelike module takes care of the groundwork for implementing and
handling file-like objects that implement a rich file-like interface,
including reading, writing, and iteration.  It also provides a number
of useful classes built on top of this functionality.

The main class is FileLikeBase, which implements the entire file-like
interface (currently minus seek() and tell()) on top of primitive
_read() and _write() methods.  Subclasses may implement either or
both of these methods to obtain all the higher-level file behaviors.

Two methods are provided for when code expects to deal with file-like objects:
    
    * is_filelike(obj):   checks that an object is file-like
    * to_filelike(obj):   wraps a variety of objects in a file-like interface

The "wrappers" subpackage contains a collection of useful classes built on
top of this framework.  These include:
    
    * TransFile:  pass file contents through an arbitrary translation
                  function (e.g. compression, encryption, ...)
                  
    * FixedBlockSizeFile:  ensure all read/write requests are aligned with
                           a given blocksize
                           
    * DecryptFile:    on-the-fly reading and writing to an encrypted file
                      (using PEP272 cipher API)

As an example of the type of thing this module is designed to achieve, here's
an example of using the DecryptFile class to transparently access an encrypted
file:
    
    # Create the decryption key
    from Crypto.Cipher import DES
    cipher = DES.new('abcdefgh',DES.MODE_ECB)
    # Open the encrypted file
    from filelike.wrappers import DecryptFile
    f = DecryptFile(file("some_encrypted_file.bin","r"),cipher)
    
The object in <f> now behaves as a file-like object, transparently decrypting
the file on-the-fly as it is read.

The "pipeline" subpackage contains facilities for composing these wrappers
in the form of a unix pipeline.  In this example, <f> will read the
first five lines of an encrypted file:
    
    from filelike.pipeline import DecryptFile, Head
    f = file("some_encrypted_file.bin") > DecryptFile(cipher) | Head(lines=5)


Finally, the function filelike.open() mirrors the standard file opening function
but tries to be clever about accessing the file - URLs are automatically fetched
using urllib2, compressed files and decompressed on the fly, and so-forth.

    This class takes a lot of the legwork out of writing file-like objects
    with a rich interface.  It implements the higher-level file-like
    methods on top of primitive _read() and _write() methods. See their
    docstrings for precise details on how they should behave.
    Subclasses then need only implement one or both of these methods for
    full file-like interface compatability.  They may of course override
    other methods as desired.

    NOTE: this class currently does not support seek() or tell().  It could
          probably be added if needed, but might be very slow...
  
    The class is missing the following attributes, which dont really make
    sense for anything but real files:
        
        * fileno()
        * isatty()
        * truncate()

        * mode
        * name
        * newlines
